    I'm one of the four students that are in charge of the League's website. We're adding functionality before events, as needed. I've worked with map APIs and PHP on the older websides. We're developing the new ones in React and Nodejs. We've made website for all our events: ITMarathon, DevMe summer camp, LAN Party etc.

  # I was mainly tasked with the back-end, preparing the events sound-wise and dealing with the problems that arose during them, this is where I've found my problem solving passion that helped me power through the bugs and errors in my code
