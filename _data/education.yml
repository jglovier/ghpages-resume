  summary: >
    During my university studies I pursued a range of coursework and hands-on experiences 
    that helped me build a diverse skill set. I was particularly interested ins topics like controlling 
    and programming Fanuc Robots, programming languages like Java and C++, which built on the foundation
    I had from high school. I gained a comprehensive understanding of computer systems, including hands-on 
    experience with logic gates and microcontrollers. I consistently challenged myself by taking mathematics 
    coursework each semester, which proved to be a difficult but rewarding experience. Through these subjects, 
    I developed a passion for understanding how computers work and how mathematics plays a crucial role in this field.

  summary: >
    While in Highschool I had time to experiment with many technologies( Unity, Blender, Arduino and among various other miniprojects). By far the most significant was when I developed and maintained an educational platform at my Highschool for an ISJ programme called "The school for Authentic Values". The web app was built using Laravel 5, bootstrap 3 and a lot of hard work from me and a collegue of mine. The teachers could upload photos and documents as proof of events that they held. Events were ordered by month and year.
