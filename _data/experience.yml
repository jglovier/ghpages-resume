# Freelance
- company: Freelance
  position: Software Developer
  duration: Jun, 2018  &mdash; May, 2020
  summary: While in Highschool I had time to experiment with many technologies: Unity, Blender, Arduino and among various other miniprojects. By far the most significant was when I developed and maintened an educational platform at my Highschool for an ISJ programme called "The school for Authentic Values". The web app was built using Laravel 5, bootstrap 3 and a lot of hard work from me and a collegue of mine. The teachers could upload photos and documents as proof of events that they held. Events were ordered by month and year.
